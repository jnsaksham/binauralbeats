# Assessing the impact of binaural beats 

### This is a music cognition experiment conducted to assess if and how binaural beats impact our ability to focus on a task. 

## To run the experiment on PsychoPy:

1. Install PsychoPy
2. Clone this repo
3. Add audio files by following these steps-
    - Open the terminal.
    - Go to this directory.

In the command line, type:

mkdir audio
cd audio
mkdir master
mkdir shifted

Audio files in "master" should be named "chillwave.wav", "edm.wav", "funk.wav", "hiphop.wav", "indie disco.wav", "rock n blues.wav"
Audio files in "shifted" should be named the same as the above, but with "_shifted" in each file name. eg - chillwave_shifted.wav, edm_shifted.wav and so on.
